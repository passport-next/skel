## Tests

The test suite is located in the `test/` directory.  All new features are
expected to have corresponding test cases with complete code coverage.  Patches
that increase test coverage are happily accepted.

Ensure that the test suite passes by executing:

```bash
$ npm test
```

Ensure that lint passes
```bash
$ npm run-script lint
```

Some lint errors can be fixed with

```bash
npm run-script lintfix
```

Coverage reports can be generated and viewed by executing:

```bash
npm run-script test-cov
npm run-script view-cov
```

Templates such as README.md can be updated via

```bash
npm run-script templates
```

If you are starting a new project run

```bash
npm run-script init-new-project
```
**WARNING** This will overwrite files which are listed in the `ignoreExisting` array of `templates/variables.js`
